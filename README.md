# Bias analysis

This repository contains resources for bias analysis
from [Conversation AI](https://conversationai.github.io/), a collaborative
research effort exploring ML as a tool for better discussions online.

We plan to publish tools showing how we analyze and ameliorate bias in our text
classification models, as well as datasets for bias evaluation and de-biasing.
